low level language( is a type of programming language that is very close to the computer’s hardware and gives the programmer direct control over memory, CPU instructions, and system resources.      )

High level language(High-Level Programming Languages are programming languages that are closer to human language and easier to read, write, and understand.
They allow programmers to write instructions without dealing directly with hardware details like memory or CPU operations.){ هي لغات برمجة قريبة من لغة الإنسان}
💻 Examples

Python

Java

C++

JavaScript

C#

this language need to compiler and interpreter

compiler:“It checks the code first. If there are no errors, it translates the code and saves a copy so it runs faster the second time compared to the interpreter.”
💻 Examples
( C ,C# ,C++,java,Go,swift )
interpreter:“It translates the code line by line every time the program runs, (so the program is relatively slow).”
💻 Examples
( python)

Programming :(means creating full software applications that can run independently.)
Examples of what programming is used for:

Desktop applications

Mobile apps

Game development

System software

Scripting:( usually means writing small programs that run inside another program or environment to automate tasks.)
Examples of what scripting is used for:

Automating tasks

Web page behavior

Server automation

Data processing

| Programming              | Scripting                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Builds full applications | Automates or controls other programs |
| Often compiled           | Usually interpreted                  |
| Can run independently    | Often needs a host environment       |
| Used for complex systems | Used for quick tasks and automation  |


 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) the language suport (oop)
Classes – Objects – Inheritance – Encapsulation – Polymorphism

 Main differences explained
@( Float)

Uses less memory

Lower precision

Faster calculations

May cause rounding errors with very precise numbers

% Used when performance is more important than accuracy.

@( Double)

More precise than float

Standard choice for decimal numbers in most programs

Still fast and efficient

% Used for most real-number calculations.

@( Decimal)

Very high precision

Stores numbers more exactly (especially base-10 values)

Slower and uses more memory

% Best for money, banking, accounting (no rounding mistakes).

< Simple rule to remember>

Float → small and fast, less accurate

Double → more accurate, general purpose

Decimal → extremely accurate, for money

| Data Type   | Memory Size        | Precision                          | Speed     | Best Use                                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Float**   | 4 bytes (32-bit)   | ~6–7 decimal digits                | Fast      | Graphics, games, scientific calculations (less precision needed) |
| **Double**  | 8 bytes (64-bit)   | ~15–16 decimal digits              | Very fast | General scientific and engineering calculations                  |
| **Decimal** | 16 bytes (128-bit) | Very high precision (28–29 digits) | Slower    | Financial and money calculations                                 |
